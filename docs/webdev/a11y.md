## Why Make Digital Experiences Accessible?

The [Americans with Disabilities Act requires](https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/) that all state and local governments (ADA Title II) and business open to 
the general public (ADA Title III) build digital experiences that are accessible.

Various web standards have been developed to check conformance with the ADA. The most notable are [Section 508](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/) (developed and used by USA federal gov) and [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (developed by W3C and used by USA federal gov).

## How Assistive Technology Works

At a high level, there are various accessibility specifications and APIs that define what information
and functionality a computer can expose to assistive technology (AT). For example, on the web, [the browser 
takes the DOM and converts it to an 'accessibility tree' which exposes all the relevant accessibility 
information and available controls to the accessibility API which is then used by AT](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/). The [Firefox Accessibility Inspector](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/)
does a really nice job showing us what this looks like for any webpage.

## Accessible HTML/CSS

A web browsers uses HTML document to expose key information to AT. The key metadata are:
* role: what role this element plats (e.g. button, text input, etc.)
* name: a human-readable name for the element and to establish relationships with other elements
* action: what actions can be taken (e.g. 'jump' for hyperlink)
* state: what are the possible states for the element (e.g. 'hover', 'focus', etc. for links)
* value: what is the target value of the element (e.g. href URL for links)

By default, HTML has reasonable defaults for accessibility information and controls when used correctly. For example see how [built-in HTML elements map to ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/). For that reason, these
are [the most important a11y considerations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) when writing HTML/CSS:
1. Use the right HTML element.
  1. E.g. Use a `<button>` instead of a custom-styled `<div>`.
2. Use the right HTML document structure.
  1. E.g. Don't store your entire page in an HTML `<table>`. Use headers, sections, articles, and [landmarks](https://accessibility.18f.gov/landmarks/) instead.
3. Provide meaningful text lables (i.e. `innerText` for `<a>`), and text alternatives (e.g. `alt` attribute for `<img>`).

## Accessible (Web) Javascript

When building custom components and experiences in Javascript, the most important thing to keep in mind is that we'll have to write our JS so that we add back in
the basic information and controls that AT expect. This means setting [WAI-ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics) appropriately.
