Create an AWS Root User . The AWS root user is an admin account with superuser priveleges (complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account). Follow these steps from AWS to create such an account. Create an AWS User . Instead of using the AWS root user for all purposes, it’s safer to follow a model of least privelege and create a user with specific permissions. This is the AWS user. | Enable IAM Identity Center . | Let AWS create an AWS organization unless you’re creating a user for an organization you work with. | Let AWS use Identity Center Directory as the identity source so you can manage users and permission groups from IAM Identity Center. | . | Create admin and power user permission sets . | Go to IAM Identity Center &gt; Permission sets | Create a permission set using a predefined permission set of “AdministratorAccess” | Create a permission set using a predefined permission set of “PowerUserAccess” | . | Create a user in IAM Identity Center | Assign the permission groups to the user . | Go to IAM Identity Center &gt; AWS accounts | Check the box next to the account you created and select ‘Assign Users or Groups’ | Go to the users tab and assign the username you created and click Next | Select both permission sets you created (AdministratorAccess and PowerUserAccess), click Next, then Submit | . | .

Otherwise, we’ll run into app install errors. First, take a look at our Gemfile to check the version of Ruby being used. If the Gemfile isn’t using the correct version (3.0.6 at the time of writing), then install the correct version using rbenv. Next, update your Gemfile to use that version of Ruby. The easiest way to do this is to let the Gemfile read .ruby-version file created by rbenv. Next, check the version of Puma being used. Look for puma ... in your Gemfile. If the Gemfile isn’t using the correct version (6.2.2 at the time of writing), then update uninstall the old version and reinstall the new version. ",
