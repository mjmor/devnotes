## Design Trends

For an overview of trends and tradeoffs, see this article from [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design/).

### 3D Design

### Skeuomorphism

Using elements from the real-world to support a metaphor that helps the user understand the interface.

### Realism

Skeuomorphism is often confused with realism. In web design, the two styles are usually found together. The primary distinction is that realism is a visual style that uses design elements and textures that mimic the physical world for purely aesthetic purposes, while skeuomorphism supports a metaphor to help users understand the interface.

### Flat

Remove all drop shadows and design cues to mimic the real world.

### Flat 2.0

Like flat, but bringing back some subtle clickability signifiers like drop-shadows.

Note: This example uses extremely long shadows which is advised against.

### Neumorphism

A focus on minimalism and lighting.

### Layout

**Auto-layout** in Figma provides a flexbox-like environment to create responsive designs.

### Typography

To modify type directly, you may convert text to vector paths:
  * Flatten text → converts to single layer (Cmd-E)
  * Outline stroke → converts to multiple layers (Shift-Cmd-O)
